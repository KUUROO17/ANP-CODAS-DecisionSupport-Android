### 📐 **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**

A **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)** visually represents how data moves through a system. It maps out the flow from input, processing, storage, and output, helping users understand the system’s structure and interactions.

Below, the DFD provides an overview of this application’s data flow, showcasing how user actions lead to data processing and final outputs within the app.
